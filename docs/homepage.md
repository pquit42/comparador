# 🐜 Anthropolis: The Rise of the Colony

    "In the underworld of soil and stone,  
    lives a realm of toil unknown.  
    Where tiny hearts beat drums of code,  
    and teamwork paves the narrow road."

## 🎮 Overview

**Anthropolis** is a real-time, strategy-driven game crafted in pure C by a band of engineering students with far too much coffee and not enough sunlight. 
Dive into the underground world of ants—each with its purpose, path, and pixel-sized dreams.

You are the Overseer, the Queen’s silent command. 

This is not just a game.  
This is **colony architecture, in motion**.

## 🧠 The Idea

Born from our fascination with **complex systems**, **parallel behaviors**, and the raw beauty of nature’s algorithms, this project is an homage to:
- swarm intelligence 🧬  
- resource management strategies ⚙️  
- and the magic of recursion, threads, and low-level control 👾  

We wrote **every line** in C. No engines, no sugar. Just pure logic, structs, and stack frames.

## 🔧 Features

- 🛡️ **Defense Protocols** – Ward off spiders, rain, and rival colonies.
- 🧬 **Behavior Simulation** – Each ant operates semi-independently using finite state machines.
- 💾 **Memory-Safe Structures** – Built with engineering-grade robustness (valgrind says hello).
- 🎨 **ASCII Graphics** – Retro charm meets tactical clarity.
